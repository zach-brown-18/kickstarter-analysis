# Optimize Your Kickstarter Campaign

• Dataset of 42,000 Campaigns from May 2009 to July 2012  
• Recommendations based on two key factors:  
    • Success rate of campaigns  
    • Average amount pledged  

In short, the analysis of this dataset yields the following recommendations.
## 1) Keep Campaigns Short - 30 days or less
## 2) Music is the safest category, Design is the highest paying category
## 3) Set a Goal of $4-6k
## 4) Focus marketing on increasing the number of backers - Even if they pay less

### 1) Keep Campaigns Short - 30 days or less
The data shows a clear trend: Shorter campaigns are more likely to succeed.  
• Pearson Correlation Coefficient: -.875  
This is due in part to the positive correlation of a campaign's goal to the planned duration.  
![Duration Success](/images/success_rate_by_duration.png)  
The average amount pledged peaks around 45 days. Thus if a project requires more funding and has a strong social media / marketing presence, the 45 day duration may be worth the risk.
