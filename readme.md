# Optimize Your Kickstarter Campaign

• Dataset of 42,000 Campaigns from May 2009 to July 2012  
• Recommendations based on two key factors:  
    • Success rate of campaigns  
    • Average amount pledged  

In short, the analysis of this dataset yields the following recommendations.
## 1) Keep Campaigns Short - 30 days or less
## 2) Music is the safest category, Design is the highest paying category
## 3) Set a Goal of $4-6k
## 4) Focus marketing on increasing the number of backers - Even if they pay less
